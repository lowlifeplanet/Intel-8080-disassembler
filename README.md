# Intel 8080 Disassembler
Following project is a basic disassembler for the Intel 8080 assembly language.



## About
The project produces a quality disassembler for the Intel 8080. 

## Goals

1. Gain knowledge of C programming language.
2. Understand lower level CPU concepts. 

## Planned features

1. Project completion.
2. Add parameters for outputting disassembly results to stdout, or to a .asm file
3. Add basic debugging capabilities in the future.

The disassembler is the first step in creating a larger project. A fully functional Intel-8080 CPU emulator will be implemented with the goal of creating a functional 8080 emulator.

## Current State

Currently, assembler does not have basic functionality. Project will be updated over time and a simplified tutorial of programming dissassemblers for beginners will be made.
